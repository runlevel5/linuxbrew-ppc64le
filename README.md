## homebrew on ppc64le support

Is it possible to port homebrew to Linux ppc64le? The answer is yes.

## How to install linux-brew on ppc64le?

* Install brew - see [doc](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)
* Apply patch with:

```

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runlevel5/linuxbrew-ppc64le/master/patches/brew/0001-support-ppc64le.patch
git am 0001-support-ppc64le.patch
```

## How do I build the portable ruby that homebrew use?

Firstly, I manually built my portable ruby version based on portable-ruby formula in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-portable-ruby. Basically I create a bash script that replicate exact way that homebrew build that formula.

Once I have a temporary binary that I could play with, I patched `Library/Homebrew/cmd/vendor-install.sh`:

```
diff --git a/Library/Homebrew/cmd/vendor-install.sh b/Library/Homebrew/cmd/vendor-install.sh
index fdd491362..1a37db38c 100644

```

Next I try to get `brew` up and running so I could build the final portable ruby version:

```
brew install --build-bottle homebrew/portable-ruby/portable-ruby
brew bottle homebrew/portable-ruby/portable-ruby
```

The end result is the final binary `portable-ruby-2.6.3.ppc64le_linux.bottle.tar.gz`

In order to get `brew` working under ppc, please applying following patches accordingly:

```
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.git
cd brew && 
git am 0001-Support-ppc64le.patch

cd linuxbrew-core && git am 0001-Support-ppc64le.patch

git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-portable-ruby.git
